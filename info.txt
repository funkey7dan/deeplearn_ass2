The file format for the tagging data is: each line contains a word SPACE tag pair. Blank lines are sentence boundaries. Your output files (testX.pos and testX.ner) should follow the same format.

The assignment will be written in python, using the numpy package. We will be using Python 3.x, and the PyTorch package. You cannot use the higher-level packages such as Keras, torchtext, or smilar packages that creates high-level architectures for you. If you are in doubt about a package, ask Yoav if its allowed.
Q&A

If you have questions, please use the Moodle Q&A forum.
